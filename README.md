The person creating & owning the sheet will be sending out the emails

1. Create a Google Spreadsheet, like this one: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y6HX0fnVxmAstAqJwZhdUWL97tIZa7ws16UD3JzjdTQ/edit?usp=sharing
2. Ensure the Sheet is called "People"
3. Open Tools > Script Editor & copy/paste Code.gs (see Screenshot1)
4. Change the text as you please & click save
5. On the left hand side click "Trigger" to create a new trigger (e.g. send out mail 1/week or 1/month) (see Screenshot2)
6. When you're done, go back to the Editor, click "Deploy" (on the top right corner). Note you might have to give the app permission to access email services. 

Now you're done. Put your name & email for testing & click "Run". Check if you got the email. 
If everything went well, you can have everyone put their names & emails into the Google Sheet
